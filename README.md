## Description

This is a simple weather dashboard app that retrieves weather data for cities from third-party API, OpenWeatherMap. When user searches a city, the dashboard will display both current weather and the weather forecast of the next 5 days. The search history is automatically saved in local storage and displayed as a button with each city name under the search bar, and when the button is clicked, user is again presented with current and future conditions ofr that city.
